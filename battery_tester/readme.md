# Battery Tester

I got my hands on a LP603436 LiPo battery and I want to use it to power my D1 mini.  
I have no idea how to do this, so naturally I soldered some contacts to the battery and pluggeg it straight into the microcontroller. It works.  
Now I need to find out how long this thing lasts, and if I can recharge it though the D1 mini.
